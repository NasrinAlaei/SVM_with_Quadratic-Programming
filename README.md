# SVM_with_Quadratic-Programming

Soft Margin SVM:

We have an educational dataset that is two-dimensional and two-class. With the help of this tutorial, we want to teach a svm classifier in Python with the help of the CVXOPT library, which has the most margins and the least errors.

The dual and primal formulation for classifying a separable linear support vector machine(svm) is as follows:(soft and hard margin svm)
